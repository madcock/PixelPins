# What are PixelPins?
They're like personalized pinball DMD displays you can wear. \
Use it as a fashion statement, or a tournament status tracker. \
Each can store up to 8 different things, chosen with a button.

## What can I put on them?
- more than 30 custom animations to choose from including...
  - video game characters
  - pinball 3-strike knockout tournament status [^1]
  - local pinball memes and slogans
  - general pinball phrases
- custom text (scrolling if needed)
  - your name
  - your pinball initials
  - whatever you want! [^2]

- `TODO: price`
- 7 color choices
  - <span style="background-color:#000;color:red">red</span>, <span style="background-color:#000;color:blue">blue</span>, <span style="background-color:#000;color:white">white</span>, <span style="background-color:#000;color:green">green</span>, <span style="background-color:#000;color:yellow">yellow</span>, and <span style="background-color:#000;color:pink">pink</span>.
- 8 customizable slots
  - Each one plays on a loop. A ninth demo mode plays all the slots, a single time through, in a loop.
- Long lasting battery
  - Rechargeable battery takes about an hour to charge when empty. [^3]
  - Lasts at least 14 hours on a full charge. [^4]
  - Comes with a Micro USB cable for charging.
- 4 selectable brightness settings. [^5]
- Lightweight, with a built in pin to attach to clothing and an optional magnet.

## Can I update it myself?
- Yes, you can put whatever text you want on the badges, but only the Windows and Linux tools can put custom animations (back) on the PixelPin.
  - `TODO: provide links to all customanimations`
- Android apps (easy)
  - There are two Android apps for loading custom text via Bluetooth, but they cannot load custom animations.
  - `TODO: provide link to instructions and download link for official Chinese app`
  - `TODO: provide link to instructions and download link for open source English app`
- Windows application (advanced)
  - This tool can load any type of supported content on the PixelPin, but it's also not translated well, and a bit buggy.
  - `TODO: provide link to instructions and download link for official Chinese app`
- Linux tools (expert)
  - Open source command line tools exist as well. Links are provided below, but only recommended if you want to take on a project, similar to a moderately difficult Raspberry Pi project. (A Pi can definitely be used to update the PixelPins.)
  - `TODO: provide link to repos for the Linux utils and info`

[^1]: Press the button to manually change your stike count and status. These things don't have WiFi, so can't update automatically.
[^2]: Please, no offensive language. I reserve the right to deny requests, but am happy to work with you to get something you like on the badge. Thanks!
[^3]: Testing showed the battery took an hour and 15 minutes to fully charge.
[^4]: On full charge and 100% brightness, the battery lasted 14.5 hours before turning off.
[^5]: 100% brightness is *very* bright and is too bright to show well in most photos. 75% is recommended.
