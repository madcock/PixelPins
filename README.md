## What are PixelPins :question:
They're like personalized pinball DMD displays you can wear. \
Use it as a fashion statement, or a tournament status tracker. \
Each can store up to 8 different things, chosen with a button.

## Can I update it myself :question:
- Yes, you can put whatever message text you want on them, but only the Windows and Linux tools can put custom animations (back) on the PixelPin.
  - `TODO: provide download links to all custom animations`
- Android apps (easy)
  - There are two Android apps for loading custom text via Bluetooth, but they cannot load custom animations.
  - `TODO: provide link to instructions and download link for official Chinese app`
  - `TODO: provide link to instructions and download link for open source English app`
- Windows applications (advanced)
  - These tools can load any type of supported content on the PixelPin, but are not translated well, and a bit buggy.
  - `TODO: provide link to instructions and download link for official Chinese app #1`
  - `TODO: provide link to instructions and download link for official Chinese app #2`
- Linux tools (expert)
  - Open source command line tools exist as well. Links are provided below, but only recommended if you want to take on a project, similar to a moderately difficult Raspberry Pi project. (A Pi can definitely be used to update the PixelPins.)
  - `TODO: provide link to repos for the Linux utils and info`

## Notes

[^1]: 100% brightness is *very* bright and is too bright to show well in most photos. 75% is recommended.
[^2]: On a full charge: 14.5 hours at 100% brightness, 21 hours at 25% brightness.
[^3]: Testing showed the battery took an hour and 15 minutes to fully charge.
