# What are PixelPins :question:
They're like personalized pinball DMD displays you can wear. \
Use it as a fashion statement, or a tournament status tracker. \
Each can store up to 8 different things, chosen with a button.

## What can I put on them :question:
- more than 30 custom animations to choose from including...
  - video game characters
  - pinball 3-strike knockout tournament status[^2]
  - local pinball memes and slogans
  - general pinball phrases
- custom text (scrolling if needed)
  - your name
  - your pinball initials
  - whatever you want![^3]

## How do I update it :question:
- Android apps (easy)
  - There are a couple of Android apps for loading custom text via Bluetooth, but they cannot load complex animations.
  - `TODO: provide link to instructions and download link for official Chinese app`
  - `TODO: provide link to instructions and download link for open source English app`
- Windows application (advanced)
  - Custom animations need to be loaded with software on a Windows machine.
  - `TODO: provide link to instructions and download link for official Chinese app`
- Linux tools (expert)
  - Open source command line tools exist as well. Links are provided below, but only recommended if you want to take on a project, similar to a moderately difficult Raspberry Pi project. (A Pi can definitely be used to update the PixelPins.)
  - `TODO: provide link to repos for the Linux utils and info`

[^1]: There's a pin on the back and a magnet included to stick them to a refrigerator or anything magnetic!
[^2]: Press the button to manually change your stike count and status. These things don't have WiFi, so can't update automatically.
[^3]: Please, no offensive language. I reserve the right to deny requests, but am happy to work with you to get something you like on the badge. Thanks!
