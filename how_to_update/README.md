## How can I update my PixelPin?

There are several ways to put new messages and animations on the PixelPin. \
- Android apps can update it wirelessly via bluetooth
- Windows applications can update it via USB cable[^1]
- Linux command line tools can update it via USB cable (and may work on Macs[^2])

The Android apps can only load custom messages, and *not* animations.

## Android (easy, but no animations)
There are two Android apps for loading custom text via Bluetooth, but they cannot load custom animations. \

## Windows applications (advanced)
These tools can load any type of supported content on the PixelPin, but are not translated well, and a bit buggy. \

## Linux command-line tools (expert)
Open source command line tools exist as well, but are only recommended if you want to take on a project. It's similar to a moderately difficult Raspberry Pi project. (A Pi can definitely be used to update the PixelPins.) \
