## How can I update my PixelPin?

There are several ways to put new messages and animations on the PixelPin.
- Windows applications can update it via USB cable[^1]
- Phone apps can update it wirelessly via bluetooth, but are limited to *only custom text updates*
- Linux command line tools can update it via USB cable (and may work on Macs)[^2]

## Windows applications
These tools can load any type of supported content on the PixelPin, but are not translated well, and a bit buggy.

- Download <a href="https://github.com/madcock/PixelPins/raw/main/software/BMP%20Badge%20LED%20V9.34.msi">BMP Badge LED V9.34</a> (recommended)
- Download <a href="https://github.com/madcock/PixelPins/raw/main/software/Mini%20LED%20Display%20V9.36.exe">Mini LED Display V9.36.exe</a>

## Phone apps
There are two Android apps and one iOS app for loading custom text via Bluetooth, but they cannot load custom animations. \

Using these is *NOT* recommended unless you only want scrolling text or simple graphics.
- Read <a href="https://badgemagic.fossasia.org/">information</a> about the apps
- Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fossasia.badgemagic">Badge Magic</a> for Android from Google Play
- Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yannis.ledcard">Bluetooth LED Name Badge</a> for Android from Google Play
- Download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ledbadge/id1461761458">Bluetooth LEDBadge</a> for iOS from App Store

## Linux command-line tools (expert)
Open source command line tools exist as well, but are only recommended if you want to take on a project. It's similar to a moderately difficult Raspberry Pi project. (A Pi could also be used to update the PixelPins.)
